    Welcome to the Colon Cancer Prediction System! ü©∫üîç
    
    Our mission is to assist in the early detection of colon cancer using advanced deep learning techniques. Upload a histopathological image, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of colon cancer. Together, let's improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes!

    ### How It Works
    1. *Upload Image:* Go to the *Cancer Prediction* page and upload a histopathological image.
    2. *Analysis:* Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential cancerous regions.
    3. *Results:* View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - *Accuracy:* Our system utilizes state-of-the-art ResNet50 model for accurate cancer detection.
    - *User-Friendly:* Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - *Fast and Efficient:* Receive results in seconds, enabling timely medical intervention.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the *Cancer Prediction* page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Colon Cancer Prediction System!

    ### About Us
